    <h2>Okay, Hear Me Out.</h2>
        <p>It has always intigued me to collect these old games for 2 reasons:<br>
        1. I like pixel art.<br>
        2. My dream is to someday collect a huge gaming memorabalia.
        I just think that someday, these games will extremely valued by collectors and many already have become nearly impossible to find, so having these will be able to show the world how anything can happen, someone born in 2010 can still own the rarest 2007 game in 2100, even if they refuse to sell it to larger colectors or buy from lower ones.</p>
